**I am a fourth year Business Analytics and Information Systems major at the University of Iowa. While I have strong interests in problem-solving, critical thinking, performance enhancements, and communication, I am also quite open-minded about the potential paths taken by various business jobs. I have learned leadership abilities from volunteering over the past five summers at Vacation Bible School. To ensure that kids have a positive experience, I assist them in staying focused and interested. Because of my extroverted nature, I thrive in stimulating and cooperative settings. In my spare time, I like to hang out with friends and family, go on walks, play strategic games, work out, and just go on impromptu adventures!**
Thank you for <sub>reading</sub> more about me!
